### 4.1. The AI-Augmented Learning Model

This program adopts an **AI-Augmented Learning** approach. AI is not just a topic but a **transversal method** used throughout all modules to accelerate learning and simulate modern professional workflows.

- **AI as a Technical Assistant (Continuous)**
  - Using AI for explaining complex concepts, debugging code, and generating boilerplate or test cases.
  - Mastering **Prompt Engineering** specific to software development.
- **Self-learning (Primary)**  
  - Documentation, guides, and assignments.
- **Trainer Guidance / Review**
  - Direction, correction, and mentoring.
- **Workshops**
  - Practical exercises and group discussions.
- **Project-based Learning**
  - Applying all knowledge to the CPL Project.

**Important Note on AI Usage:**
- **Integrity First:** AI should be used to *understand*, not just to *complete*. You must be able to explain any code generated with AI assistance.
- **Critical Thinking:** Always verify AI outputs. Understanding the limitations and risks of AI is a core part of the methodology.
